Computer engineer for passion; #crypto enthusiast; Home Automation and #OpenHAB fanatic; technology lover.

- ðŸ‘‹ I am a big fan of IT and technology and currently I'm working as a Freelance Computer Engineer and my main activities are IT consultant and software developer.
- ðŸ‘€ My main job is about analysis, design and development of business software systems and databases. I mainly work alone and I take care of all the design steps, from the requirements to the analysis of the processes, from the choice of the architecture and technology up to the software design and the creation of the database, from the server management up to the use of bug tracking and version management software. I worked and still work for both large companies and small customers, dedicating time, passion and professionality in the same way. If necessary, I join existing teams or use trusted collaborators. In recent years I was involved in technical training as an authorized Oracle teacher, providing OOP theory, Java programming and SQL language courses.
- ðŸŒ± My luck was to be able to start working as far back as 1998, during my college time; this allowed me to gain the necessary experience to be able to face the job market with the right determination after graduation.
